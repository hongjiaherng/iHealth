# iHealth
## A desktop app for patients to reserve and book appointment time in a clinic


Halo bros welcome here~

**Take some time to get yourself familiar with this platforrm first**
1. Install git on windows 10 (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSGuir8BUeU
      
2. (Optional) I find this website might act as a guide for us to use this platform 
      - https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/git/collaboration/lesson/
      
3. The website would make no sense at all at first, so can follow along this simple guide on github first
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVRQoVRzMIY (u can look for other videos as well)
      - In the video, he used **"sublime text"**, which is a text editor like **"notepad"** or **"visual studio code"**, don't be confused, just use **notepad** if you do not have any other text editor. 
      
4. So, let's make this to your local machine after you understand the basic of git

      1st step:
      
            - Copy the HTTPS / SSH links which will look like this https://github.com/hongjiaherng/iHealth.git
            - Open command prompt / git bash on your local computer and cd to the directory which you want to put this assignment folder

      | Command(e.g.):        |
      | :-------------------- |
      | cd Desktop\Assignment |

      2nd step:
      
            - clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine using this command

      | Command: |
      | :-------------------- |
      | git clone https://github.com/hongjiaherng/iHealth.git |

            - You're done! Our iHealth repo has been available in your local machine

      3rd step:
      
            - Now, let's try to add your name down below in your local machine then commit it and push it to the remote repo
            
      | No.  | Steps                                              |
      | :--- | :------------------------------------------------- |
      | 1    | Add your name down below                           |
      | 2    | Save and add your changes in your local machine    |
      |      | **git add README.md**                              |
      | 3    | Check your status of the file                      |
      |      | **git status**                                     |
      | 4    | Commit your file in your local machine             |
      |      | **git commit -m "<Your commit message>"**          |
      | 5    | Push your changes to the remote repo master branch |
      |      | **git push -u origin main**                        | 
      
      **Note that we use 'main' instead of 'master' because starting from Oct 1 2020, GitHub officially changed the name of default branch from 'master' to 'main'**
      
                        

      Insert your name when you're done
      | :----- |
      | 1. jiaherng |
      | 2. Desmond //So damn coool |
      | 3. Chai Nam Chi // very hard sia |
      | 4.   Boo Zhan Yi     |
      | 5. Chong Jun Yi // damn professional |


      **- Actually we not neccessarily need to work with the confusing "command-line", we can merely use the GitHub user interface instead,**
      **but if everybody is comfortable with it, our workflow would be smoother and everybody gets to learn.**
      
      **- Try to go through and follow along the video first, to grab the basic of using git & github**

----------------------------------

**Second task: Update your local machine repo to keep track with the remote repo (SERIOUS ALERT!!! ONLY COME HERE WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THE FIRST PART)**

1. Alright! for those who are done with cloning the repo to your local machine, you might have wonder what if other people update the master branch of the repo on GitHub, then your repo on your local machine is not keeping up the track anymore

2. So now, you have to manually update the the local repo from our remote repo (we call it as 'pull' the remote repo to our local machine)
      | Do this (in the repo's directory): |
      | :--------------------------------- |
      | git pull origin main | 
3. After that, u will have the latest bugless repo on your local machine!
