A desktop app for patients to reserve and book appointment time in a clinic


Halo bros welcome here~

**Take some time to get yourself familiar with this platforrm first**
1. I find this website might act as a guide for us to use this platform
      - https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/git/collaboration/lesson/
      
2. The website would make no sense at all at first, so can follow along this simple guide on github first
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVRQoVRzMIY (u can look for other videos as well)

      - **If you realized that there is no 'master' branch in GitHub, you are right! GitHub renamed the default branch of our own repositories from 'master' to 'main'**
      
      
      
      **- Actually we not neccessarily need to work with the confusing "command-line", we can merely use the GitHub user interface instead,**
      **but if everybody is comfortable with it, our workflow would be smoother and everybody gets to learn.**
      
      **- Try to go through and follow along the video first, to grab the basic of using git & github**
